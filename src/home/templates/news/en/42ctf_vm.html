As you may already be aware, solving CTF challenges require a lot of tools and it may be difficult to find out which ones you need to install. </br>
We've made a VM with everything you need for 42CTF challenges so that you can focus on what is really important: flag ! </br>
All you need to do is download this <b><a href="/media/xubuntu-42ctf.ova">OVA</a></b> and import it in <b><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtual Box</a>.<br></b>
So, what are you waiting for ?
