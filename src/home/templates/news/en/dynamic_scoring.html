You noticed a little change in the 42CTF scoreboard ?<br><br>

Don't panic, all your flags are safe and sound. We just switched to dynamic scoring. It means that challenges points are not fixed anymore: they will now decrease with each solve.<br>

Challenges points start at 200, and cannot go below than 5.<br><br>

We hope that this will allow better reflecting of the actual difficulty of the challenges. Limited-time events are not affected by this change.
